A blockquote didn't look right here, so I just made it into a paragraph. I got the information from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger.*/

<p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.<br>
    It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside.<br>
    It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and<br>
    generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its<br>
    requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about <br>
    two years before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.</p>
