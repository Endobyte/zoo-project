  Some mountains form when the big slabs of rock—called tectonic plates—that make up the Earth’s crust crash into each other. Over millions of years, the sheets of rock push up and over one another, creating the mountain. Others form when vents in the Earth’s surface erupt and spew lava out onto the ground. The lava piles up and cools. Over millions of years, the many layers of hard lava become a mountain.
  <br><br>
  Mountains are on every continent. The longest mountain range is over 40,000 miles long—and 90 percent is under the ocean! Called the Mid-Ocean Ridge, it wraps around the globe like the seams of a baseball. The longest aboveground mountain range is the Andes. Running along the entire west coast of South America through seven different countries—including Argentina, Chile, and Colombia—it’s 4,700 miles long.
  <br><br>
  From bottom to top, a mountain has several biomes of life. At the very bottom, foothills often have lush deciduous forests, meaning that the trees lose their leaves in winter. Higher up are coniferous forests with tall pines and other evergreen trees.

<h2>Red Pandas</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda">
  The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a carnivoran native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the giant panda.
  <br><br>
  The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body. It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. It is also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear.

<h2>Grizzly Bears</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear">
  The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly, is a population or subspecies of the brown bear inhabiting North America.
  <br><br>
  In addition to the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis), other morphological forms of brown bear in North America are sometimes identified as grizzly bears. These include two living populations — the Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi) and the peninsular grizzly (U. a. gyas) — as well as the extinct California grizzly (U. a. californicus†), Mexican grizzly (formerly U. a. nelsoni†), and Ungava-Labrador grizzly (formerly U. a. ungavaesis†). On average, grizzly bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller.
  <br><br>
  Although grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears, though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.
